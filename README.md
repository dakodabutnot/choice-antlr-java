### Java 'Choice' interpreter

An attempt at interpreting my own file format, **Choice**, in **ANTLR** for **Java**, and I say _attempt_ very loosely since I have no idea if what I'm doing is okay or not, but, hey-ho.

If you want to learn more about Choice I have a wiki setup in [this repo](https://github.com/dakodabutnot/choice).
